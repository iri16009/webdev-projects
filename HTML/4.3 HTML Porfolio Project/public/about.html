<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm an electronic engineer from Guatemala who's learning web development.</p>

<p>I'm starting out with Angela Yu's course, which has been really good as of now and I highly recommend.</p>

<p>Besides learning web development, I also have data analytics skills with Python, R, and Tableau. 
  I also love to automate things with Python, that has been my main focus in my past jobs.
