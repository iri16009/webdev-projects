<h1>The Best Movies According to Gaby</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Parent Trap</h3>
<p>I love how this movie showed 2 cultures and it also has one of the best soundtracks.</p>
<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>Read all the books and watched all the movies. Books were better though. 
    It's amazing how J.K. takes you to a completely different and magical world.</p>
<h3>Taken</h3>
<p>Amazing movie. It shows how our world is unsafe and how women are victims of abduction, even in places we think are safe.</p>
